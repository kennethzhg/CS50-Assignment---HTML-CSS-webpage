This is a simple webpage which I have created as part of the CS50 edX online course.

You can view it on https://CS50xCourseWebsite.kennethzhg.repl.co, or download these files and run it on your offline code editor (loading will be faster).

I am still new to coding, so there are some issues and ideas I have.

Issues:
- elements do not resize according to screen size. Still trying to figure out.
- zooming in beyond 150% on PC causes the divs containing the texts to be displaced from their intended position.

Ideas:
- on every refresh (or for every 24 hours since last visit or every midnight UTC+0), a random Sage's Quote will be shown. Currently the quotes are hardcoded. I am still learning how to write the JavaScript (and possibly need to use the JQuery library) to inject this dynamism.
