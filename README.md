This is a simple webpage which I have created as part of the CS50 edX online course.

You can view it on https://CS50xCourseWebsite.kennethzhg.repl.co, or download these files and run it on your offline code editor (loading will be faster).

I am still new to coding, so there are some issues and ideas I have.

Issues:
- elements do not resize according to screen size. Still trying to figure out.
- zooming in beyond 150% on PC causes the divs containing the texts to be displaced from their intended position.
- text size do not auto-fit the div dimensions (the div height is between the top and bottom strings of the bamboo scroll (see /Images)). I am still learning how to use JavaScript to inject this dynamism.

Ideas:
- on every refresh (or for every 24 hours since last visit or every midnight UTC+0), a random Sage's Quote will be shown. Currently the quotes are hardcoded. I am still learning how to write use JavaScript (includng the relevant libraries) to inject this dynamism.
