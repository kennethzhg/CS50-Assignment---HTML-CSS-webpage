This is a simple webpage which I have created as part of the CS50 edX online course.

You can download these files (or clone/fork this repository) and view it on localhost.
Alternatively, you can view it on the Github Page that I have published (https://kennethzhg.github.io/CS50-Assignment-HTML-CSS/) after modifying these codes slightly (more on this at https://github.com/kennethzhg/CS50-Assignment-HTML-CSS/tree/editedforGHpages).

I am still new to coding, so there are some issues and ideas I have.

Issues:
- elements do not scale according to screen size, and thus it is not mobile-friendly. Still trying to figure this out; meanwhile please view the website on PC.
- at some point, zooming in on PC causes the divs containing the texts to be displaced from their intended positions.
- text size do not auto-fit the div dimensions (the div height is between the top and bottom strings of the bamboo scroll (see /Images)). I am still trying to figure out if I need  JavaScript to inject this dynamism.
- there are some inconsistencies in the Chinese font. This is beyond me as I am not the creator of the font package.

Ideas:
- on every refresh (or for every 24 hours since last visit or every midnight UTC+0), a random Sage's Quote will be shown. Currently the quotes are hardcoded. I am still learning how to write use JavaScript (includng the relevant libraries) to inject this dynamism.
